Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and excels at many different types of computing. It is used to run large, well-known websites. It is used to process log files and make sense of their contents. It might even be used to create some of your favorite games! Not only that, but with a simple, expressive syntax, Python doesn't have the gotchas and edge-cases that make some other languages hard to learn. 

In this course, instructor Derek Jenson will help you to learn to start coding with the Python language. You'll start with the vary basics to lay a solid foundation for future learning. Then, you'll go deeper, learning more advanced ways of manipulating data with commonly used data structures. Later on, Derek will share some pointers with you about how to get data in and out of files and even store complex data structures in them. Finally, you'll learn about some of Python's powerful built-in networking features to write code that can talk to other computers on the internet.

Let's not wait any longer! Time to dive in.
